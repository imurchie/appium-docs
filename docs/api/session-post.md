## Creating a new Session

Creating a new session is done by sending a `POST` request to the `/session` endpoint. The server takes your [desired capabilities](desired-capabilities.html)
and attempts to create a new session that fits them.

This is what it takes.

This is the sort of thing that shows up in the logs.

This is a reference to the different ways to invoke it in the supported languages.
